Borg Project
============

**Warning**: no longer maintained.

[This research project](https://nn.cs.utexas.edu/pages/research/borg/) has achieved its goals and wound down. For an in-depth description of its design and results, see [the associated dissertation](https://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/silverthorn.dissertation12.pdf).

What Was It?
------------

Modern heuristic solvers can tackle difficult computational problems, but each solver performs well only on certain tasks. An algorithm portfolio uses empirical knowledge—past experience of each solver's behavior—to run the best solvers on each task.

The borg project includes a practical algorithm portfolio, a web-based visualization tool for solver evaluations, and a research platform for the algorithm portfolio setting.
